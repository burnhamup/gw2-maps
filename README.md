# GW2-Maps

Inspired by gw2est.com

The goal of this project is to let a user with an Guild Wars 2 API key view achievements and unlocks grouped by map or release.

I realized this could be done entirely in Javascript, much like official Wiki can use your API key to track unlocks in collections or achievements. It can be run easily as a static page, and updated easily through some config files. Mantaining this project long term will be easier if others can easily alter or update it.

# Roadmap

At the moment it's just a proof of concept I put together a few years ago last time GW2 EST hadn't updated promptly.
I hope to spend some time on the UI to get something useful, and then start backfilling the config files.
